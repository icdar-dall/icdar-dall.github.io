        <p>
         The importance of low-resource document analysis is multifaceted, particularly in the fields of cultural preservation, data scarcity, linguistic research, and technological applications. Firstly, low-resource languages often embody unique cultural and historical contexts. Document analysis facilitates the digitization and preservation of these linguistic materials, providing crucial resources for understanding human history and cultural evolution. For instance, many endangered languages possess vast amounts of scanned documents, which can be analyzed to create valuable linguistic and cultural repositories. Secondly, low-resource languages typically suffer from a lack of large-scale annotated datasets, posing challenges for training machine learning models. Document analysis techniques, such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and document layout analysis, enable the extraction and structuring of data from existing documents, thereby mitigating data scarcity issues. Moreover, document analysis plays a pivotal role in enhancing machine translation capabilities. Monolingual data extracted through OCR can be utilized to improve machine translation for low-resource languages, which is particularly critical for languages with limited parallel corpora. Additionally, document analysis supports linguistic research by enabling the study of language variations and historical documentation, shedding light on the evolution and unique features of these languages. Finally, document analysis enhances the accessibility and usability of low-resource language documents. For example, advancements in OCR systems for non-Latin scripts allow researchers to extract text more efficiently from scanned documents, enabling applications such as content summarization and information retrieval. In summary, low-resource document analysis is not only a vital tool for cultural preservation but also a key driver of language technology development and academic research.
